Pseudocode

I. Capture date from users on log-in with fb button. 

    1) $(#user_input).on('submit', saveDate)
    2) store this date as a variable, var userDate = $(#date).val();

II. Determine if user date is within range of photo date. 

    1) If userDate is within range of photoDate, proceed to compare months and years. 
    2) Else, display an alert that says "come on, you're not that old. Keep your time travel within reason."

III. Compare userDate with photoDate 

    1) var userDate- find the month and year with getMonth() and getYear()
    2) store under userMonth and photoMonth// userYear photoYear
    2) If userMonth == photoMonth && photoYear == userYear, display...





put a loop 
for (i=0; i<response["data"].length; i++)
var photoDate = response["data"][i]["created_time"]


do some conversion for comparing dates. parse out years, months, and dates. find a way to compare dates. 

check for months and years.
